# FUTURE-LOAN-APPROVAL-WITH-EXPLAINABLE-AI
#  Future Loan Approval Prediction with Explainable AI

This project predicts the approval of future loan applications using supervised machine learning models. It emphasizes *transparency and interpretability, using tools like **SHAP* and *LIME* to explain model predictions â€” making it accessible and useful for *data analysts* and financial decision-maker
 Project Goals
- Predict whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant data.
- Analyze the factors affecting loan approval using *explainable AI (XAI)*.
- Help data analysts interpret model outputs to support *data-driven business decisions*
## ðŸ›  Tools and Libraries
- *Languages*: Python
- *Libraries*: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- *ML Models*: Scikit-learn (Random Forest, Logistic Regression), XGBoost
- *XAI*: SHAP, LIME
- *Platform*: Jupyter Notebook
## Project Structure
This project demonstrates how data analytics and machine learning can be combined to predict future loan approvals and explain the factors influencing the decisions.  Data exploration and cleaning - Using SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) to interpret model outputs - Generating actionable insights for financial decision-making .
